## Composition vs Inheritence.

- Inheritence is built on the idea that an 'object' can encapsulate both data and methods that process that or other data. If you want a diff object to have the same methods as another it will need to 'inherit' from another. I guess it will need to inherit everything from that parent class (???). The object **IS A** thing that has a certain combination of triats.

why can't you inherit only what you want from a Parent class???

- Where composition tries to modularize everything and an object can construct or compose itself with whatever methods and traits as it wants. An object **HAS A** method or trait.

Composition == **HAS A**

Inheritence == **IS A**
