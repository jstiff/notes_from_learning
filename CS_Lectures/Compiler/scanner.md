## Scanner

When you are building a scanner you are essentially defining all of the possible /'legal' tokens in that given language.

From the perspective of the scanner a valid language is a sequence of valid tokens that are defined to be valid.

Finite Automota and RegEx are tools for 'recognising' the language....'recognize' means that a FSA has taken a string and processed it to determine if it is 'accepted' or not. Does the FSA **end** in an 'accept'?
