### Non-Deterministic Finite Automata

In NFA we will have 'choices' or branching of the computation. Branching will be executed in parallel and every possible state is traversed in this computational model.

Essentially each choice is a 'spawning' of a new machine. And the NFA accepts a string input if **any** one state is accepted. Multiple spawed threads????
