### What is a Binary file???

- The modern binary number system, the basis for binary code, was invented by Gottfried Leibniz in 1689 and appears in his article Explication de l'Arithm√©tique Binaire.
  - George Boole published a paper in 1847 called 'The Mathematical Analysis of Logic' that describes an algebraic system of logic, now known as Boolean algebra. Boole's system was based on binary, a yes-no, on-off approach that consisted of the three most basic operations: AND, OR, and NOT.
  - This system was not put into use until a graduate student from Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Claude Shannon, noticed that the Boolean algebra he learned was similar to an electric circuit. Shannon wrote his thesis in 1937, which implemented his findings. Shannon's thesis became a starting point for the use of the binary code in practical applications such as computers, electric circuits, and more.
- **every** file that has content is a binary file, **every single one without exception**.
  - the file extension only provides information on how to interpret the 8 bit contiguous data(bytes).
    - all just bytes.
    - headers are used to provide more information about what kind of data a binary is
      - Executable and Linkable Format (ELF).
        - common standard file format for executable files, object code, shared libraries, and core dumps.
      -
- how does the binary map to current?
