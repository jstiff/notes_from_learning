### How Fonts/Characters render to a screen.

- A computer font (or font) is implemented as a digital data file containing a set of graphically related glyphs, characters, or symbols.
- There are three basic kinds of computer font file data formats:
  1. **Bitmap** fonts consist of a matrix of dots or pixels representing the image of each glyph in each face and size.
  - A bitmap font(raster font) is one that stores each glyph as an array of pixels (that is, a bitmap).
  -
  2. **Vector** fonts (including, and sometimes standing as a synonym for 'outline fonts') use BÃ©zier curves, drawing instructions and mathematical formulae to describe each glyph, which make the character outlines scalable to any size.
  3. **Stroke** fonts use a series of specified lines and additional information to define the profile, or size and shape of the line in a specific face, which together describe the appearance of the glyph.
