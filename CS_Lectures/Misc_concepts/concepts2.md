## Misc concepts...

- ASCKII
  - ASCII is a subset of UTF-8, not its own scheme. UTF-8 is backwards compatible with ASCII.
  - ASCII only has 256 characters with very few symbols...
- Unicode (“Unicode Transformation Formats”)
  - unicode can write upto 65,536 characters and symbols...
  - Because Unicode characters don't
    generally fit into one 8-bit byte,
    there are numerous ways of storing
    Unicode characters in byte
    sequences, such as UTF-32 , UTF- 16 and
    UTF-8.
