### What is a Type system?

- a type is just a set of values.
  - an INTEGER type is the **set** of values from min_Int to max_Int, inclusive.
  - Once we consider types as set of values, we realize immediately one set may be a subset of another set.
    - the set {1-10} integer values is a **subset** of the set {1-50} Int values.
    - or the set {1-100} is a subset of the set of all integers {Int}.
    - If a type is included in another type there is a logical equivalence or consistentcy present
