### Polymorphism

- Ad Hoc vs Parametric....
- **'Ad Hoc'** as an example when you do 'operator overloading'...meaning when an operator or function can be implmented on more than one type.

  - '+' or fn Add().....
    - if '+' will work on 1, 1.6, "one"....integers, floats and strings....this is overloaded and semantically ambiguous.
    - Thus, the name + actually refers to three or four completely different functions.

- **parametric polymorphism** is a way to make a language more expressive, while still maintaining full static type-safety.
