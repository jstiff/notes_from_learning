## Start by asking what is 'computation'?

- Computation is a 'process' or a means to solving a problem which can be executed on 'devices'.

  - a "device" can be anything from a computer to a piece of paper and pen. A stone tablet
    can be a means to solving a problem.(device)
  - The step by step instructions of this process to solving a problem is known as an "Algorithm".

- 'Finite Automata' is a model of a computation with a finite amount of memory or
  states. Which can be exeuted on any number of devices.
