#### Petri Nets

- introduced in 1962 by Dr. Carl Adam Petri.

- A modeling formalism in computer science, system engineering and many other disciplines. Petri nets combine a well defined mathematical theory with a graphical representation of the dynamic behavior of systems.
- The 'theoretic' aspect of Petri nets allow for **percise modeling**, while the graphical
  representation of Petri nets enable visualization of the modeled system state changes.
- Petri net == 'a kind of bipartite directed graph populated by three types of objects'.
  1. places
  2. transitions.
  3. directed arcs. (connect places to transitions or transitions to places)
