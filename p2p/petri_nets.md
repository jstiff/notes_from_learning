#### Petri Nets

- introduced in 1962 by Dr. Carl Adam Petri.

- A modeling formalism in computer science, system engineering and many other disciplines. Petri nets combine a well defined mathematical theory with a graphical representation of the dynamic behavior of systems.
- The 'theoretic' aspect of Petri nets allow for **percise modeling**, while the graphical
  representation of Petri nets enable visualization of the modeled system state changes.
