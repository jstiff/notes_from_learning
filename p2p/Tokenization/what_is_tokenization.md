- Tokenization is the process of converting physical (and non-physical) assets into digital tokens on a blockchain.
- The concept of tokenization has actually been around since the 1970s as a data security mechanism for financial services. Traditional finance companies implement tokenization to protect confidential information such as financial statements, credit card numbers, and other personally identifiable information.
